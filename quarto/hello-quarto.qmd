## Meet Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. Quarto uses the **Markdown** syntax for authoring *HTML*, *PDF*, and *MS Word* documents. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#| label: cars

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#| label: pressure
#| echo: false

plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo: false` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
