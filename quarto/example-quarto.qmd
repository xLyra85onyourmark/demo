Just start typing like normal!

Let's make our text **bold**!

-   Hello!

-   Hola!

-   Bonjour!

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
x = 1:10 # giving us a sequence of 1, 2, ..., 9, 10
print(x)

x_mu = mean(x)
x_median = median(x)
x_sd = sd(x)

print(x_mu)
```

We have the variable `x` with a mean of `r x_mu`.
